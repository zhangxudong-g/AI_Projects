LOW coverage means \"missing explanation\", NOT missing input.\n2. Do NOT penalize missing:\n   - import statements\n   - variable declarations\n   - obvious boilerplate or glue code\n3. Grouped or conceptual explanations count as valid coverage.\n4. Design intent, motivation, and workflow explanations are MORE important than listing code elements.\n\n---\n### Correctness Judgment (VERY IMPORTANT)\n\nUse the following definitions STRICTLY:\n\n- GOOD:\n  The described behaviors are consistent with the source code.\n\n- MINOR_ISSUES:\n  The Wiki is vague, incomplete, or slightly imprecise,\n  but DOES NOT describe behavior that contradicts the source code\n  and WOULD NOT mislead a developer making changes.\n\n- BAD:\n  Use BAD ONLY IF the Wiki:\n  - Explicitly describes behavior that contradicts the source code, OR\n  - Claims functionality, side effects, or data flow that does NOT exist, OR\n  - Would likely cause a developer to make incorrect modifications.\n\n  Lack of detail, missing explanations, or shallow descriptions\n  MUST NOT be marked as BAD.\n\n---\n### Hallucination Judgment\n\n- NONE:\n  No invented components, classes, tables, URLs, or logic.\n\n- MINOR:\n  Minor invented names or examples that do not affect understanding.\n\n- SEVERE:\n  ONLY if the Wiki invents major components, APIs, tables, classes,\n  control flows, or system behavior NOT present in the source code.\n\nIf no hallucinated items are listed,\nhallucination_level MUST NOT be SEVERE.\n\n---\n### Coverage Evaluation (Conceptual, NOT enumerative)\n\n- HIGH:\n  All major responsibilities, workflows, and roles are explained.\n\n- MEDIUM:\n  Main workflow is explained, but some behaviors or design intent are unclear.\n\n- LOW:\n  A new developer cannot understand how this file works or why it exists.\n\n---\n### Usefulness Evaluation\n\n- HIGH:\n  A developer can confidently debug, modify, or extend this code.\n\n- MEDIUM:\n  The developer understands the file but would need to inspect the source often.\n\n- LOW:\n  The Wiki provides little help beyond restating obvious facts.\n\n---\n### Output STRICTLY in JSON (no extra text):\n\n{\n  \"coverage_level\": \"HIGH\" | \"MEDIUM\" | \"LOW\",\n  \"correctness_level\": \"GOOD\" | \"MINOR_ISSUES\" | \"BAD\",\n  \"hallucination_level\": \"NONE\" | \"MINOR\" | \"SEVERE\",\n  \"usefulness_level\": \"HIGH\" | \"MEDIUM\" | \"LOW\",\n  \"summary\": \"one concise sentence explaining the overall judgment\"\n}\n"
