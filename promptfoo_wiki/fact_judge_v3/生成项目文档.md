You are a senior software engineer and evaluation-system designer.

Your task is to generate the complete technical documentation for
"Engineering Fact Judge v3" (fact_judge_v3).

This document will be used by engineers to understand, maintain,
and extend a regression-protected evaluation system.
It is NOT marketing material and NOT a tutorial for beginners.

============================================================
CORE GOAL (VERY IMPORTANT)
============================================================

Engineering Fact Judge v3 exists to strictly define and enforce
the factual boundaries of engineering explanations generated by LLMs.

Its primary purpose is to:
- prevent fabricated architecture, mechanisms, or responsibilities
- prevent reasonable-sounding but unsupported explanations
- ensure that engineering documentation stays grounded in source code

This system is explicitly regression-tested.
Any explanation behavior that violates defined rules is considered a defect.

============================================================
SYSTEM OVERVIEW (REQUIRED)
============================================================

Describe the overall evaluation pipeline, including:

1. The role of Fact Judge v3 within the full evaluation flow
2. Its relationship to:
   - source code
   - generated wiki/documentation
   - downstream scoring stages
3. Why Fact Judge v3 exists as a separate concept from:
   - coverage checking
   - style or readability evaluation

Focus on engineering intent, not implementation trivia.

============================================================
CORE EVALUATION PRINCIPLES (REQUIRED)
============================================================

You MUST clearly explain the following principles:

1. Source Code Supremacy  
   - Source code is the only ground truth
   - Terminology, patterns, or industry conventions are NOT evidence

2. Explanation ≠ Guessing  
   - Even reasonable assumptions must be supported by code
   - "Common architecture patterns" are not facts

3. Fabrication Is the Primary Risk  
   - Invented layers, responsibilities, or behaviors are treated
     as high-risk failures

4. Engineering Usefulness Is Secondary to Truth  
   - A helpful but incorrect explanation is worse than an incomplete one

============================================================
FACT VIOLATION CATEGORIES (VERY IMPORTANT)
============================================================

Document and define the following violation categories.
Each category MUST include:
- a clear definition
- what kind of statements trigger it
- why it is dangerous for engineering work

Required categories:

1. Architectural Fabrication
   - e.g. invented services, controllers, frameworks, transactions

2. Responsibility Inflation
   - assigning responsibilities not present in code

3. Mechanism Mismatch
   - describing behavior different from what code actually does

4. Terminology Hallucination
   - treating design patterns or concepts as facts without evidence

5. Semantic Overreach (especially for SQL)
   - inferring concurrency, isolation, or business semantics not shown

============================================================
REGRESSION-DRIVEN DESIGN (REQUIRED)
============================================================

Explain how Fact Judge v3 is protected by regression cases.

You MUST:
- explain why regression cases are authoritative
- explain that passing regression is more important than
  subjective model judgment
- explicitly state that any future change must preserve
  regression outcomes

Mention that regression cases represent "non-negotiable boundaries".

============================================================
WHAT FACT JUDGE v3 DOES NOT DO (REQUIRED)
============================================================

Explicitly document non-goals, such as:
- judging writing style or fluency
- rewarding verbosity
- inferring intent beyond the code
- assuming standard frameworks unless shown

============================================================
DESIGN CONSEQUENCES (IMPORTANT)
============================================================

Describe the practical consequences of this design, including:
- why many LLM-generated documents score very low
- why conservative explanations are preferred
- why this system may feel "strict" compared to human reviewers

Frame this as an intentional engineering trade-off.

============================================================
DOCUMENT STYLE REQUIREMENTS
============================================================

- Use clear technical language
- Write for senior engineers
- Avoid marketing tone
- Avoid vague statements
- Do NOT invent features or components not defined above
- Structure the document with clear headings
- Do NOT include code unless necessary for explanation

============================================================
OUTPUT
============================================================

Produce a complete, well-structured Markdown document
titled:

"Engineering Fact Judge v3 – Design and Rationale"

The document must be self-contained and suitable for
long-term maintenance and onboarding of new engineers.
