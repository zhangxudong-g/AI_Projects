## Purpose
This class provides a simple logging utility for audit-related messages.

## Behavior
- Accepts a message string
- Writes the message to standard output

## Notes for Modification
- The current implementation uses console output
- If persistence or async handling is required, this class would be the extension point

The documentation is accurate but intentionally limited in scope.
